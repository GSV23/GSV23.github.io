Title : A cluster structure on the category O for shifted quantum affine
algebras

Abstract : I will report on a joint work with C. Geiss and D. Hernandez.
We prove that the Grothendieck ring of the category O for the shifted
quantum affine algebras, introduced by Hernandez in arXiv:2010.06996, has
the structure of a cluster algebra of infinite rank, with explicit initial
seeds parametrized by reduced expressions of the longest element of the
associated (finite) Weyl group. The initial cluster variables are
constructed by means of the new Weyl group action of Frenkel and Hernandez
(arXiv:2211.09779). In type A,D,E, we obtain a surprising connection with
the Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky cluster algebra structure on the open
double Bruhat cell of the corresponding simple algebraic group.

Title: Quivers with self-duality and possible applications to cluster
algebras

Abstract: A quiver with self-duality is a quiver isomorphic to its
opposite. For example, the linearly-oriented quiver of type A is a quiver
with self-duality. They were introduced by Derksen and Weyman with the name
"symmetric quivers". The category of representations of such quivers is
endowed with a self-duality, and the underlying vector space of self-dual
representations can be endowed with a symplectic or orthogonal form. We
call them symplectic or orthogonal quiver representations, or symmetric
representations for short. In the variety of symmetric representations the
group acting is not anymore a product of general linear groups, but instead
there are also the symplectic and the orthogonal group as factors. By a
theorem of Magyar, Weyman and Zelevinsky two symmetric representations are
isomorphic if and only if they are isomorphic as quiver representations. To
my surprise I discovered that not much is known for the orbit closures. In
collaboration with Magdalena Boos  we prove that for symmetric quivers of
type A, the closure of a symmetric orbit is precisely the intersection of
the closure of the orbit for the usual action with the variety of symmetric
representations. To prove this we show that the orbit closures are induced
by isotropic subrepresentations. This result is used in the work of my
Ph.D. student Azzurra Ciliberti to find a character associating to each
indecomposable symmetric representation of a symmetric quiver of type A
(with an odd number of vertices) a cluster variable of a cluster algebra of
type B and C.

Title: Shadows of numbers: supergeometry with a human face

Abstract: In this elementary and accessible to everyone talk I will explain
an attempt to apply supersymmetry and supergeometry to arithmetic. The
following general idea looks crazy. What if every integer sequence has
another integer sequence that follows it like a shadow? I will demonstrate
that this is indeed the case, though perhaps not for every integer
sequence, but for many of them. The main examples are those of the Markov
numbers and Somos sequences. In the second part of the talk, I will discuss
the notions of supersymmetric continued fractions and the modular
group, and arrive at yet a more crazy idea that every rational and every
irrational has its own shadow.

The « shadow ideas » arose from the notion of cluster superalgebra (joint
with Michael Shapiro).

Title: Integrable transformations on centroaffine polygons

Abstract: U. Pinkall interpreted the Korteweg-de Vries equation as a
completely integrable evolution on centroaffine curves. Accordingly,
symmetries (the Backlund transformation) of the KdV equation also can be
realized as transformations of centroaffine curves. I shall discuss a
discrete version of these transformations, where the curves are replaced by
polygons. The centroaffine version of polygon recutting of V. Adler will be
considered as well. The focus of the talk is on the geometrical aspects of
the problem (and the cluster-algebraic aspects are up for grabs). This is a
joint work with M. Arnold and D. Fuchs

Title: Weight systems related to Lie algebras

Abstract: V. A. Vassiliev's theory of nite type knot invariants allows one
to associate to such an invariant a function on chord diagrams, which are
simple combinatorial objects, consisting of an oriented circle and a tuple
of chords with pairwise distinct ends in it. Such functions are called
weight systems . According to a Kontsevich theorem, such a correspondence
is essentially one-to-one: each weight system determines certain knot
invariant.

In particular, a weight system can be associated to any semi-simple Lie
algebra. However, already in the simplest nontrivial case, the one for the
Lie algebra sl(2), computation of the values of the corresponding weight
system is a computationally complicated task. This weight system is of
great importance, however, since it corresponds to a famous knot invariant
known as the colored Jones polynomial.

The last year was a period of signi cant progress in understanding and
computing Lie algebra weight systems, both for sl(2)- and gl(N)-weight
system, for arbitrary N. New recurrence relations were deduced, which allow
for a lot of explicit formulas. These methods are based on an idea, due to
M. Kazarian, which suggests to extend the gl(N)-weight system to
permutations.

Questions concerning possible integrability properties of the Lie algebra
weight systems will be formulated.

The talk is based on work of M. Kazarian, the speaker, and the students P.
Zakorko, Zhuoke Yang, and P. Zinova.

Title: Hamiltonian geometry and the golden ratio in the Euler
hydrodynamics

Abstract: The binormal (or vortex filament) equation provides the
localized induction approximation of the 3D incompressible Euler equation.
We present a Hamiltonian framework for the binormal equation
in higher-dimensions and its explicit solutions that collapse in
finite time. On the other hand, by going to lower dimensions, we observe
a curious appearance of the golden ratio in the motion of point vortices in
the plane. This is a joint work with C.Yang and H.Wang.

Title: 3D Farey graph from ideal tetrahedra

Abstract: We construct a 3-dimensional analog of the Farey tesselation and
show that it inherits many properties of the usual 2-dimensional Farey
graph. In particular, we get a classification of SL_2-tilings over
Eisenstein numbers in terms of pairs of paths on the graph. We also get a
3-dimensional counterpart of the Ptolemy relation. The talk is based on an
ongoing work joint with Oleg Karpenkov and Khrystyna Serhiyenko.

Title: Incidences and tilings

Abstract: We show that various classical theorems of real/complex linear
incidence geometry, such as the theorems of Pappus, Desargues, Möbius, and
so on, can be interpreted as special cases of a single "master theorem"
that involves an arbitrary tiling of a closed oriented surface by
quadrilateral tiles. This yields a general mechanism for producing new
incidence theorems and generalizing the known ones.

This is joint work with Pavlo Pylyavskyy.

Title: From Koornwinder operators to cluster algebra: Proof of the
Macdonald-Q-system conjecture

Abstract: We present various constructions of commuting difference
operators for the theory of Koornwinder polynomials. We show how a
specialization/limiting procedure produces a functional representation for
quantum Q-system cluster algebras associated to affine and twisted types
A,B,C,D, also interpreted as discrete algebraic quantum integrable systems.
The correspondence uses Koornwinder duality and a suitable
Fourier-Whittaker transform allowing to interpret Koornwinder polynomial
Pieri rules as relativistic Toda systems. (Based on joint work with Rinat
Kedem).

Title: Poisson geometry and representation theory of cluster algebras

Abstract: One of the fundamental constructions in the area of cluster
algebras is the Gekhtman-Shapiro-Vainshtein Poisson structure on an upper
cluster algebra. We prove that their spectra have a Zariski open torus
orbit of symplectic leaves and provide an explicit description of it. It is
a far reaching generalization of the complement of the Richardson divisor
of Schubert cells in Lie theory. Using Cayley-Hamilton structures, we show
that, if a root of unity upper quantum cluster algebra is finitely
generated, then the same holds for the corresponding classical algebra and
that the quantum algebra is finitely generated module over a canonical
central subalgebra that is isomorphic to the classical one. Using these two
methods we give a description of the Azumaya locus of the quantum algebra
at roots of unity. This is a joint work with Shengnan Huang, Thang Le, Greg
Muller, Bach Nguyen and Kurt Trampel.

Title: Hurwitz numbers and ribbon gluing, real and complex case.

Abstract: Classical (or complex) Hurwitz numbers are integers solving
several problems in combinatorics (the number of sequences of
transpositions with a product of a specified cyclic structure), algebraic
geometry (the number of rational functions with prescribed pole divisor and
critical values), low-dimensional topology (the number of ways to obtain a
given surface gluing ribbons to a collection of disks), and more. We
discuss these problems together
with their real (or "twisted"') analogs.

The talk is based on a joint work with R.Fesler.

Title: Clusters, integrable systems and tame symbol

Abstract: A tame symbol is a bimultiplicative 2-cocycle on the group of
nonvanishing functions a circle given by an explicit formula. The tame
symbol is related to Heisenberg group, resultant, Witt ring, Gauss
reciprocity and many other subjects. We will use the tame symbol to define
a homology class (with values in the multiplicative group) of a Lagrangian
subvariety of a cluster A-variety. Say that a Lagrangian subvariety is
Bohr-Sommerfeld if this class is trivial. We will show in the example of
dimension 2 that every Bohr-Sommerfeld curve gives a solution of a
difference equation, which is a quantization of the
equation of the curve with quantization parameter equal to 1. The solution
is given by quantum dilogarithms of algebraic functions.

Title: Tiled surfaces, string algebras and laminations

Abstract: We consider tilings of surfaces. We show how they can be used as
a geometric model for string algebras, a large class of algebras satisfying
monomial relations. We consider laminations on tiled surfaces. They give
rise to classes of locally gentle algebras and infinite dimensional
modules. We study these laminations and their properties. This is joint
work with R. Coelho Simoes and with B. Marsh.

Title: Some configuration spaces and the categorification of cluster
algebras

Abstract: The starting point for this talk is the realization of certain
configuration spaces as affine varieties defined by so-called
"u-equations".  We will see how this construction can be interpreted and
generalized using the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras,
using the tools of additive categorification of cluster algebras, and in
particular the interpretation of F-polynomials and g-vectors.

This is a report on ongoing work with Nima Arkani-Hamed, Hadleigh Frost,
Giulio Salvatori and Hugh Thomas.
